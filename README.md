## 🚀 What’s Inside

- 📓 **Notebook** for finetuning VLMs with Reinforcement Learning on this dataset  
- 📓 **Notebook** for VLMs Evaluation on this dataset  
- ⚡ Ready-to-use for fine-tuning custom LLMs, vision-language models, or benchmarking pipelines

## 🚀🚀 Getting Started
To quickly load and explore the dataset in Python, you can use the 🤗 `datasets` library:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load the test split of the Im2TeX dataset
dataset = load_dataset('AI-4-Everyone/Im2TeX')

# Print dataset info
print(dataset)
```
